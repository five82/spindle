# Legacy Python Reference

This directory contains the deprecated Python implementation of spindle. It survives here solely as a historical reference while the Go rewrite matures. The code is no longer maintained, should not receive new features or fixes, and will be removed once outstanding comparisons against the Go stack are complete.

If you need context from the old implementation, feel free to inspect it here. But do not update this reference code.
