// Package ripping orchestrates the MakeMKV ripping stage for queued discs.
//
// The handler primes queue progress, streams MakeMKV updates back into the
// store, manages staging-directory layout, handles drive ejection, and emits
// notifications when ripping starts or finishes. When hardware or MakeMKV isn't
// available, it can synthesize placeholder outputs so the rest of the workflow
// keeps functioning in development environments.
//
// Centralize new ripping behaviours here so the workflow manager interacts with
// a single, well-tested abstraction.
