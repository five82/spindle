# Ruff Linting Analysis for Spindle

## Currently Suppressed Rules Assessment

### SHOULD KEEP SUPPRESSED (Pragmatic):
- `G004` (f-string in logging) - More readable, minimal performance impact
- `PLR0913` (too many arguments) - Sometimes necessary for complex functions
- `E501` (line too long) - Handled by formatter
- `ARG001/ARG002` (unused arguments) - Required for callbacks/interfaces
- `T201` (print found) - OK for CLI tools

### SHOULD SELECTIVELY FIX (Security/Correctness):
- `BLE001` (blind except Exception) - Can hide bugs, should be specific
- `S608` (SQL injection) - Even with false positives, worth reviewing
- `S603/S607` (subprocess security) - Should validate inputs
- `B904` (raise from) - Helps with debugging, should use where appropriate

### SHOULD GRADUALLY ADDRESS (Code Quality):
- `PLR0915/PLR0912/PLR0911` (complexity metrics) - Refactor complex functions
- `C901` (cyclomatic complexity) - Break down complex logic
- `TRY401` (redundant exception in logging) - Easy to fix
- `PLC0415` (import outside top-level) - Can cause issues

## Recommended Approach:

1. **Phase 1 - Fix Critical Issues** (Security & Correctness)
2. **Phase 2 - Address Complexity** (Refactor large functions)
3. **Phase 3 - Clean up Easy Wins** (Like TRY401)
4. **Keep Pragmatic Suppressions** (Like G004, ARG001)

## Example Refactoring Priority:

```python
# HIGH PRIORITY - Fix blind exceptions
# Current:
except Exception as e:  # BLE001
    logger.error(f"Failed: {e}")

# Better:
except (ValueError, IOError, RuntimeError) as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed: {e}")

# MEDIUM PRIORITY - Reduce complexity
# Split large functions like _rip_disc() into smaller pieces

# LOW PRIORITY - Keep pragmatic choices
# f-strings in logging are fine for readability
```
